          Hi, I'm Steven Royster. </br>
          Thanks for checking out my website. Now this is where im supposed to tell you who I am in less than 140 characters
          because thats about all our minds can handle nowadays...thanks TWITTER. </br></br>
          Anyways, I'm the creative guy. I enjoy working within a team, and being the one with the "weird" ideas. I've come to embrace my creativity,
          and in the 21 years I've spent on this beautiful planet, I've aquired some hobbies. Some of those hobbies being: photograghy, drawing, weight lifting, skateboarding, fishing, music, and reading. When I'm not doing any of that, I'm expressing myself through website design. I love building websites! I'm currently a college student pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at North Central College.
          </br> College has taught me a lot, but most of all college has taught me how to learn. I've grown as a person, and gained the maturity to apply myself in order to successfully reach my goals. </br>  .....thanks for reading
          </br> favorite color is #f72525
